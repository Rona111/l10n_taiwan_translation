# How to do it
We use github to communicate and collaborate these following topics
* source codes: main work
* tickets / issues: if you find one problem / question to fix / ask, post it here
* Wiki: if needed.

If you do not know how to do it, please check this ticket as well.

Even President Obama is using github, '', and make first contribution to the open source world :)  http://no.pingwest.com/n/1290.html
You should do it as well.
